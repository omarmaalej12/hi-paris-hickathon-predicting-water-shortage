## Project Overview

Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue due to climate change and unsustainable water use. This project, developed during the Hi!ckathon #5, addresses this challenge by predicting water shortages using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. By leveraging a dataset of over 3 million entries, we integrated weather, hydrology, socio-economic data, and piezometry to predict groundwater levels during critical summer periods.

### Key Highlights
- **Innovative AI Solutions**: Built predictive models that deliver high accuracy for water shortage forecasts.  
- **Sustainability Focus**: Proposed actionable insights for mitigating water scarcity impacts.  
- **Scalability**: Designed a framework suitable for large-scale implementation across various regions.

## Code Overview

The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository, `water_shortage_groupe48.ipynb`, contains the implementation of our predictive models and the analytical workflow.

### Key Sections in the Notebook
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing data, normalized variables, and performed feature engineering.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and correlations.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Developed and evaluated multiple AI models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
   - Used cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.

3. **Results Visualization**:
   - Visualized key findings through graphs and metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to evaluate model accuracy.
   - Presented water shortage predictions for various regions during summer periods.

4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Proposed recommendations based on the AI model predictions to optimize water usage and mitigate shortages.
